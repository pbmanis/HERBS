Notes on changes to run on an M1

Note: I use a virtual environment generated by make_env.sh
This environment is specific, and is easy to regenerate on different systems. 

Requirements not listed:

The following is needed to get HDF5 working (9/21/2022):
brew install hdf5
brew install c-blosc
export HDF5_DIR="$(brew --prefix hdf5)"
export BLOSC_DIR="$(brew --prefix c-blosc)"

For imagecodecs, will also need:
brew install libaec
